-- All-time leaderboard. Run in the Supabase SQL Editor AFTER
-- leaderboards-v2.sql (it depends on profiles.share_code + country).
-- Additive only: three SECURITY DEFINER functions + grants. No table changes.
--
-- The board ranks on the same points that drive the badge, so the ladder a
-- player already sees on their profile is the ladder they are ranked by. No
-- second scoring system.
--
-- POINTS ARITHMETIC LIVES IN THREE PLACES AND MUST BE CHANGED IN ALL THREE:
--   frontend/src/utils/badges.ts  (POINT_WEIGHTS + aggregateRows) — canonical
--   supabase/badges.sql           (player_points, for explicit user ids)
--   supabase/leaderboards-alltime.sql (this file, for the whole field)
-- No test can catch a drift between them: the SQL needs a database. Grep for
-- POINT_WEIGHTS before touching any weight, and keep the walkover guard
-- (cards_played_total >= 5) identical everywhere.
--
-- Decay is deliberately NOT applied here. The badge decay bleeds the surplus
-- above your current tier so a tier never demotes; that is about progress, not
-- standing. An all-time board is a record of what happened, so an inactive
-- player keeps the rank they earned. "Who is hot right now" is the weekly board.
