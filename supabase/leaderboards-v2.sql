-- Leaderboards v2 — identity, cosmetics, and rank context for the full-page
-- boards. Run in the Supabase SQL Editor (replaces both v1 board functions;
-- the return type changed, hence drop + recreate). Table changes are
-- additive: two nullable profile columns. The share_code default backfills
-- existing rows with distinct codes.
--
-- Re-run after adding badges: both board functions now also return user_id
-- so the client can look up each row's badge via player_points (badges.sql).

-- Shareable, rename-safe identity for /p/<code> profile URLs.
