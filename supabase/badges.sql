-- Public points lookup for visible seats (waiting room, game over, every
-- in-game opponent). Run in the Supabase SQL Editor. Additive only: one
-- SECURITY DEFINER function + grant. game_results RLS is owner-select-only,
-- so showing an opponent's badge needs a definer read. Exposes nothing but
-- the computed points and days-idle for explicitly requested user ids.
--
-- Mirrors the weighted sum in frontend/src/utils/badges.ts (POINT_WEIGHTS +
-- aggregateRows). The floored inactivity decay is applied client-side
-- (applyDecay) from `days_idle`, so the tier table lives in one place (TS).
-- Keep the weights and the walkover guard (cards_played_total >= 5) in sync.
-- The same arithmetic runs a third time in supabase/leaderboards-alltime.sql,
-- which ranks the whole field instead of explicit ids. Change all three.
