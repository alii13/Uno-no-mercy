-- Dossier sections for the public profile page (/p/<share_code>). Run in the
-- Supabase SQL Editor AFTER profile-pages.sql and leaderboards-alltime.sql
-- (this depends on profiles.share_code + country). Additive only: three
-- SECURITY DEFINER functions + grants. No table changes.
--
-- public_profile() returns one row of aggregates, which is enough for the
-- badge and the personal bests but cannot answer two things the dossier shows:
-- where a player stands in the field, and when they took each badge. Both need
-- data that owner-only RLS keeps out of the client, so both are computed here
-- and returned already reduced.
--
-- POINTS ARITHMETIC LIVES IN FOUR PLACES AND MUST BE CHANGED IN ALL FOUR:
--   frontend/src/utils/badges.ts       (POINT_WEIGHTS + aggregateRows) — canonical
--   supabase/badges.sql                (player_points, for explicit user ids)
--   supabase/leaderboards-alltime.sql  (the whole field)
--   supabase/profile-dossier.sql       (this file)
-- No test can catch a drift between them: the SQL needs a database. Grep for
-- POINT_WEIGHTS before touching any weight, and keep the walkover guard
-- (cards_played_total >= 5) identical everywhere.
--
-- profile_promotions ALSO duplicates the tier thresholds from badges.ts BADGES.
-- That is the only copy of the ladder outside TypeScript. Change both together.
--
-- EXPOSURE NOTE: profile_recent_games widens what a public profile shows from a
-- W/L form strip to the last N games in detail. It is deliberately bounded, and
-- returns no game_id and no user_id — only what the activity row renders. If a
-- private-profile setting ever ships, this is the function it has to gate.

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Where this player stands, globally and in their own country.
-- alltime_my_rank answers this for the CALLER via auth.uid(); a profile page is
-- about somebody else, so the target comes from the share code instead.
--
-- KNOWN COST, accepted deliberately (2026-08-29): this aggregates the whole of
-- game_results on every call. Measured at 32,912 rows / 3,308 scored players:
--
--   GroupAggregate (actual rows=3308) <- Incremental Sort (actual rows=32912)
--   Execution Time: 449.344 ms
--
-- The ranking itself is free; the aggregate is the whole cost, and it grows
-- with total games played rather than with users. alltime_leaderboard and
-- alltime_my_rank pay the identical cost, so the site pays it three ways.
--
-- The fix, when it starts to hurt: one materialised view of the scored set
-- (user_id, country, games, points), refreshed on a schedule, with all three
-- functions reading from it — profile rank becomes a lookup plus a ranking over
-- ~3k rows. pg_cron 1.6.4 is available on the project but not installed. The
-- trade is staleness bounded by the refresh interval, which an all-time board
-- can absorb: it already ignores decay for the same "record of what happened"
-- reason. A trigger-maintained table is the other option and is rejected here,
-- because it would put the points arithmetic in a fifth place.

-- When this player took each badge.

-- Derived, never stored: the points formula is replayed over their games in
-- order, and the first game whose running total reaches a threshold is the game
-- that bought that tier. Mirrors frontend/src/utils/promotions.ts, which does
-- the same replay client-side for the signed-in owner (who already holds their
-- own rows and needs no round trip).
--
-- Every term of the sum is non-negative, so the running total only ever grows
-- and the earliest crossing really is the promotion. The distinct-day term is a
-- running count of first-games-of-a-date rather than a plain sum.
