/**
 * Room invites, receiving side: the live channel, the list, and dismissing.
 *
 * Sending lives in multiplayerStore, on the room socket. Only the room can
 * confirm the sender is sitting in it, and an invite nobody can vouch for is
 * a claim rather than a fact - see game-server/src/invites.ts.
 *
 * Separate from socialStore because this owns a subscription. A player on the
 * home screen holds no game socket, so the invite arrives over Supabase
 * Realtime instead - the one place in the app that uses it, and the reason
 * the invites table has a SELECT policy while friendships has none.
 *
 * The realtime payload carries the row, not the sender's name, so an event is
 * a nudge to re-read rather than data to render.
 *
 * Feature-detects like every definer surface: until invites.sql runs, the
 * first read fails, `unavailable` latches, and no channel is opened.
