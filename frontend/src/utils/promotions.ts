/**
 * Promotion history — the dates a player crossed each badge threshold.
 *
 * Derived, never stored: replaying the same weighted sum badges.ts already
 * defines over the player's games in order tells us which game bought each
 * tier. Nothing new is recorded per game, so a player who had history before
 * badges shipped still gets a full career.
 *
 * Promotions run on EARNED points, which only ever grow. Inactivity decay bites
 * the surplus toward the next tier, never the tiers already taken, so this list
 * is stable: a badge that appears here can never disappear from it later.
