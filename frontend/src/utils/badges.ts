/**
 * Badge ladder — the points-based evolution of the win-only rank ladder
 * (utils/ranks.ts). One number (points) drives one badge, shown on every
 * player everywhere they appear.
 *
 * Points are a weighted sum over stats we already record per game. The badge
 * is cumulative and permanent: once earned, a tier can never be lost. What
 * bleeds during inactivity is only the surplus above your current tier — the
 * progress toward the NEXT badge — floored so a badge never demotes.
 *
 * The weighted sum is mirrored by supabase/badges.sql's player_points(), which
 * returns the same `points` plus `days_idle`; the client applies the decay
 * (applyDecay) so the tier table lives in exactly one place — here.
 *
 * supabase/leaderboards-alltime.sql repeats the same sum a third time to rank
 * the whole field. A weight change here must be made in both SQL files too.
