/**
 * What's New — the single source for the top-bar panel, the release card, and
 * /changelog. Shipped in the bundle rather than a table: every announcement is
 * a deploy anyway, so a table would only add a fetch, a policy, and a way for
 * the copy to drift from the code it describes.
 *
 * Newest first. Ids are ISO dates and must sort — the unread dot compares them
 * as strings. Never add an entry for a change that has not deployed; adding one
 * is what makes the dot appear.
 *
 * `level` is a per-entry decision the human makes at ship time, not a default
 * you pick. See "Shipping updates to players" in CLAUDE.md.
 *   quiet — panel entry and a dot. Almost everything.
 *   loud  — also fires a one-time card. Roughly one per quarter, for a change
 *           that alters what a player does. Needs `bodySignedOut` too.
