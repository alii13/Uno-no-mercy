/**
 * Public rooms that are alive right now, for the lobby's live-games entry.

 * Deliberately not on the landing page. The 78% spectate-to-play conversion
 * that motivated this is measured on players who were already in a game and
 * got knocked out — not on cold visitors — and at current traffic a landing
 * strip would be empty most of the time, which advertises the opposite of
 * what it intends. This surface lives where players already are and hides
 * itself completely when nothing is running.
